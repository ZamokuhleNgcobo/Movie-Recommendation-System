Movie Recommendation System
Overview
In today’s digital age, recommender systems play a crucial role in helping users discover relevant content amidst vast options. This project focuses on developing a movie recommendation algorithm using techniques such as content-based filtering or collaborative filtering. The goal is to predict how users will rate movies they have not yet seen based on their historical preferences.

Project Goals
Implement a recommendation system capable of predicting movie ratings for users.
Explore and compare different recommendation techniques (content-based vs collaborative filtering).
Evaluate the performance of the recommendation algorithm using relevant metrics.
Provide an intuitive interface for users to receive personalized movie suggestions.
Key Features
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies similar to those a user has liked based on movie attributes such as genre, actors, directors, etc.
Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies based on the preferences and ratings of similar users.
Prediction: Predicts how a user will rate a movie using machine learning algorithms.
Evaluation: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are used to evaluate the model’s performance.
Economic and Social Impact
The successful implementation of this recommendation system can:

Enhance user experience by suggesting movies aligned with their preferences.
Increase user engagement and platform affinity by exposing users to relevant content.
Drive revenue through increased content consumption and user satisfaction.
Getting Started
Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommendation-system.git
Install dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Data Preparation:

Prepare the movie dataset including attributes like title, genre, actors, etc.
Prepare user ratings data (historical preferences).
Model Training:

Choose and train the recommendation model (content-based or collaborative filtering).
Evaluation:

Evaluate the model’s performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.
Prediction:

Predict movie ratings for new users based on their historical preferences.
